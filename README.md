## Project Title
Analysing the Social-Economic Impact of Wireless
Mobile Services During and Before COVID-19 Using
Topic Modelling and Sentiment Analysis on Tweets

### Project Description
Social media platforms can be used as a data source for measuring public opinion on
various topics such as wireless mobile services. Twitter is a suitable platform that is
able to map the sentiments. In this research the influence of wireless mobile services on values 
such as user satisfaction (social effect), affordability (economic effect) and
willingness (social effect) is researched. This research is conducted through a created
system that uses topic modeling and sentiment analysis. HDP, LDA and LSI are the
topic models used to map the various topics. While Multinomial Logistic Regression,
Naive Bayes, Decision Trees and Random Forest are the sentiment models that map
the sentiment per value. All these models are evaluated for their performance with the
aim of choosing the best model for the system. This research will also determine the
sentiment over time for each value and the sentiment for the companies Mint Mobile
and Infinity Mobile. These companies differ from policy, so this analysis provides
insight into the influence of company policies on these values.
